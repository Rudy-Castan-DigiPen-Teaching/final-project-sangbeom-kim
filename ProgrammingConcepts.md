Shapes

Shapes in programming is simply creating a shape you want in programs. There are simple shapes that you use variables such as position, size, angle, which are shapes such as rectangle, circle, arc and there are some shapes that you have to calculate to build. If you want to make shapes like star or regular polygons, this will be the case. You can also make your own shape, usually by writing every position of all the vertexes. Way to make triangle and quadrangle is similar to this.

Colors

In programming, colors are usally used by RGB or HEX. In RGB, you change amount of red, green, and blue by the range of 0 ~ 255 to represent different colors. The original idea is mixing colors in light, where adding colors will make it brighter. HEX has the same idea, but it changed the range of 0 ~ 255 in hexadecimal. So every color get the range of 00 ~ FF.

Variables

Variables are used to change something's value in the program. You initialize a variable, and use operators to modify it. You can use this to change an object's position, object's color, object's count and lots of more things. You should be careful about using variable's name, because if you make a existing variable again, the program would not work properly.

Conditional Statements

Conditional Statements are what we say if something is true, then this or if something is not true, then this. Usually if - else is used in programming. You can use this if you want to exucute certain function in a certain condition, and does not in other conditions. In if - else, the logic goes if something(variable is at a certain value, mouse is clicked, keyboard is pressed) is true, excute somemthing(return changed values, execute a function, draw shapes) and else, excute something else.

Loops

In programming loop means doing something over and over. In p5js draw is one big loop, and it excutes every time the last excution is over. There are loops such as while loop or for loop. While loop is a loop that goes while A is true, excute B. For loop is similar, but in for loop it has initialization, condition and update. Inside the loop, if something is updated and no longer meets the condition, the loop ends.
